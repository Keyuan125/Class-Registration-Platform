# Course Registration Platform

## Detailed Description

We don’t like the course registration page that we are currently using in UIUC. We think it’s outdated and most of the user interface is not intuitive enough for a new student to use. Therefore, we decided to build a more modern version of it. With our project, we aim to provide more comprehensive information to the student to help them make decisions.

## Usefulness

As we stated above, we are creating a new course registration system, whose functionality is similar to the one we currently have. However, our system will provide extra components that help our students to make their decisions and manage courses.


## Realness

Our course data and professor’s information will be from the university website. In order to obtain the data, we’ll either do web scraping or manually input all the information. Since we are unable to get the real student information, we plan to generate fake student data with some api.


## Functionalities

We’ll store student, course, professor, and login information into our database. Basically, our website will allow students to search and register for classes; allow administrators to perform any tasks(including delete course, overwrite registration, etc). Other than these, we plan to add multiple components to our website to help students make decisions. First, students can search courses with CRN, course name, department, etc. Once the students find a course, we will provide them with professor’s information, course information. If students select the course, our application will allow students to visualize the current schedule with their other courses. With this functionality, we think we will be able to give our students a great experience.
