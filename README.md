## Project Summary

We don’t like the course registration page that we are currently using in UIUC. We think it’s outdated and most of the user interface is not intuitive enough for a new student to use. Therefore, we decided to build a more modern version of it. With our project, we aim to provide more comprehensive information to the student to help them make decisions.
