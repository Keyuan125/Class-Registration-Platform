- Project Title: Course Registration Platform

## Project Summary

A brand new course registration platform that allows students to register in an easy and intuitive way. With our platform, students can easily access class descriptions, professorâ€™s intro, and any other information that they need before choosing a class. While selecting a class, students are also able to visualize their current calendar to check if there is a conflict. Additionally, our platform also allows administrators to maintain and update the course information.
